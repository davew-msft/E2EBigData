# EndtoEndBigData

Getting started with Big Data can be daunting if you haven't utilized the tooling. In this session we'll start with a large data set and load it into Spark/Databricks using standard Big Data ingestion techniques. We'll build a basic ML model using Jupyter notebooks against Spark to show you data analytics. We'll finish with Power BI visuals against the data. The goal is to show the end-to-end Data Science Process to discover and enrich and model data.

Requirements:  

* Azure subscription

## Goals

* develop proficiency with Spark
* build ML models
* Introduction to Deep Learning
* this is a short workshop so we can't cover everything, but we want you to come away with your appetite whetted to learn more

## Audience

* anyone interested in learning about data science using a hands-on approach
* some experience with notebooks helps
* some python experience helps
* some experience with Azure

## What we won't cover

In a one day workshop we can't cover everything.  Please keep that in mind.  

## Workshop Contents

0. [Provision Databricks Exercise](provision.md).  

  Data files can be found at `/data`  
  Lab files can be found at `/Labs`  
  consider downloading Power BI if you don't have it

1. Understand the basics of databricks

  use the `Basics.dbc` file




## Notes

Due to time I removed administration.dbc and replaced it with Basics.dbc.  EH streaming was mostly removed but can be added back.  If needed, restore it back.
