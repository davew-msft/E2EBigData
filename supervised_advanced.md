This workshop builds upon your knowledge of supervised learning by evaluating and optimizing your algorithms.  

Ensure you at least follow the setup setups in the [previous lab](supervised.md).  We reuse this data.  

Please note that you will need to change file locations in these notebooks.

## Steps

1. Classification Evaluation.ipynb
2. Regression Evaluation.ipynb
3. Parameter Tuning.ipynb
4. Cross Validation.ipynb

## Knowledge Check

* Can you explain RMSE in your own words?
* Do you think you get more "lift" by tuning parameters or by creating better features (data)?
